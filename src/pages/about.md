When I first started learning to program, I felt as clumsy as a lobster, tapping away with the tips of my pincers. It took me a long time to produce a simple 'Hello World'. Everything felt like magic, and React seemed like a snow-capped mountain, impossible to climb.

But after many years of development, I still feel like I'm just scaling one mountain only to find countless more waiting for me. I'm still a lobster, only now I can tap a little faster. I hope that one day, I'll be able to see the ocean beyond these mountains. Maybe there's nothing there, but I hope there is.

I am a lobster in the world of programming.
